<h1>Checkpoint Legs</h1>

<p>A 'leg' is the route between two checkpoints; each route is a series of legs, and since some routes 
skip checkpoints that are found on other routes, not all checkpoints are visited sequentially</p>

<p>This page shows each leg, along with the average times taken to complete them, and which teams are on them</p>

<table class='table table-hover'>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Leg</th>
			<th>From</th>
			<th>To</th>
			<th>Average Time To Complete</th>
			<th>Teams on leg</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<% FOREACH id IN legs.keys.sort %>
