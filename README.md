# FellScout

This is a continuation of the 'felltrack scripts'; some tools that we use at the Chiltern 20 and Southern 50
events around the FellTrack system:

https://felltrack.com

It's called 'FellScout' because we're Scouts and that sounded less creepy than ScoutTrack.

# Running

Ideally, in the root of the repo

```
./run.sh
```

Which will set the right env vars. More-directly:

```
cd FellScout
plackup bin/app.psgi
```
